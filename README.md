# Express React & Flux Boilerplate

I've tried to create a simple starting point for building node apps with React and Flux ready to go out of the box. This is a work in progress, and pull requests or issues are greatly appreciated.

Additional Details
* Uses LESS to compile CSS
* Uses Browserify to modularize JS
* Uses Nunjucks for easy HTML templating
* Includes `styleguide.html` file for creating a styleguide for your app
